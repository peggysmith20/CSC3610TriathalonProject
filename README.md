Final Project Requirements
Triathlon : Group 3

Create an application to keep track of the participants in a triathlon.  Your program will keep track of the times in three events:  Running, Swimming, and Biking.  Your program will calculate who the winner is in the Male category and the Female category based on the total lowest score of the three events.      

Create a class called Athlete that holds the first name, last name, gender, and number of the athlete.
Create three separate classes for each of the three events:  Running, Biking and Swimming.  Each should hold the time (use a double so you can hold fractions of a second).
These classes should have static data members of 60 minutes.  This is the maximum time of any one event.  Compare the Athlete’s time of each event to the static data member.  If the athlete’s time exceeds the 60 minutes, output a message that they are disqualified.
Get the data for each of the Athletes and write it to a database. 
Calculate the lowest total score for the Males and the Females.
Output the winners’ names, time for each event, and total time. 
Display a sorted list of all males with their last name and total score.
Display a sorted list of all females with their last name and total score.
