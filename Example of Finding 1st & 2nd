FOR OUR PROJECT WE ARE SUPPOSE TO FIND WHO IS THE WINNER IN THE RACE. BELOW I HAVE CREATED A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF HOW TO FIND 
SMALLEST AND SECOND SMALLEST ELEMENT IN THE ARRAY USING MAX. 

A Simple Solution is to sort the array in increasing order. The first two elements in sorted array would be two smallest 
elements. Time complexity of this solution is O(n Log n).

A Better Solution is to scan the array twice. In first traversal find the minimum element. Let this element be x. 
In second traversal, find the smallest element greater than x. Time complexity of this solution is O(n).

An Efficient Solution can find the minimum two elements in one traversal. Below is complete algorithm.

Time Complexity: O(n)



Algorithm:

1) Initialize both first and second smallest as INT_MAX
   first = second = INT_MAX
2) Loop through all the elements.
   a) If the current element is smaller than first, then update first 
       and second. 
   b) Else if the current element is smaller than second then update 
    second




public class  secondsmallest
{
    /* Function to print first smallest and second smallest
      elements */
    static void print2Smallest(int arr[])
    {
        int first, second, arr_size = arr.length;
 
        /* There should be atleast two elements */
        if (arr_size < 2)
        {
            System.out.println(" Invalid Input ");
            return;
        }
 
        first = second = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr_size ; i ++)
        {
            /* If current element is smaller than first
              then update both first and second */
            if (arr[i] < first)
            {
                second = first;
                first = arr[i];
            }
 
            /* If arr[i] is in between first and second
               then update second  */
            else if (arr[i] < second && arr[i] != first)
                second = arr[i];
        }
        if (second == Integer.MAX_VALUE)
            System.out.println("There is no second" +
                               "smallest element");
        else
            System.out.println("The smallest element is " +
                               first + " and second Smallest" +
                               " element is " + second);
    }
    /* Driver program to test above functions */
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int arr[] = {12, 13, 1, 10, 34, 1};
        print2Smallest(arr);
    }
